# Welcome!

__First, thank you for considering contributing to this repository.__

## Here's a list of what has been implemented:
1. Triggers for bullish orders
2. Close prices as LTP
3. Telegram interface
4. MongoDB interface

## Here's what's missing:
1. A way to authenticate users via telegram app using a token or password.
2. Option for both bullish and bearish triggers
3. Option for price i.e. Open, High, Low, Close
4. A few stock prices can not be retrieved via yfinance library, find them and use alpha vantage API as fallback.
5. Scrape list of stocks in all Nifty broad market indices, check the list [here](https://www.niftyindices.com/indices/equity/broad-based-indices)

## What else you can contribute:
1. Bug reporting
2. Testing
3. Spreading the word (the best contribution ever!)
